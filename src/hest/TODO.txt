for super long things like "tend glyph", it would be nice to have
seperator lines between the long versions of options, to visually
group them somewhat.

currently the "input nrrd" option to unu comes last as a way of allowing
hest to do error checking on all other (more error prone) options.  But
it would be nice to indicate a parsing order seperate from the option order.
